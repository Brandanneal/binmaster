Hello! Welcome to BinMaster - an AH flip bot

To configure the bot, you need to know JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). To help validate that you're doing filling it
in correctly, you could use a tool like https://jsonlint.com/. You can also reference the docs in the Discord to assist
you in configuring the bot.

To get started, head over to the config.json file.

The first thing you would need to do is to set the "api" fields. The "key" parameter
is your AHM api key. This is only obtainable by purchasing it at https://binmaster-bot.sellix.io/

Next, you need to set the "hypixel_key" parameter, this is your Hypixel API key. It is used to fetch
active auctions and possibly other things in the future. You can get it by going on hypixel and running /api new

Finally, you can fill out the "bot" fields, and run the program. Cheers!
